# Reinforcement-learning---Area-of-a-Circle-
Try out a simple reinforcement learning: 
    Environment : Take a 2 D circular graph with radius 10 units 
    States : [-10, -10],..[10, 10];  
    Conditions: The consecutive points are only chosen in one direction. Can choose any number of points 
    Reward : Area created with points
